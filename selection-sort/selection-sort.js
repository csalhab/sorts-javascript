// Create our unsorted array

// seed data in unsortedArray

//TODO: create selectionSort() function
//start by making the 1st element as the smallest number
//then loop thru to find the actual smallest number in array by checking if next element is smaller than starting 1st element

//check if smallest is actually the 1st element
//if it is nothing else needed
//but if it's not, swap the elements

//return sorted array

//INITIALIZATION - kick it off

//ECHO OUT - log out values
